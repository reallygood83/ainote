title: 🏄‍♂️ How to Use Surf
---

## 💡 Basic Concepts

---

Surf is designed to help you explore and create with your personal context. Here are some key concepts to get you started:

- 📚 **Notebooks:** Notebooks are where you collect and organize your notes and personal media (PDFs, YouTube videos, documents, images, & more). You can create multiple notebooks for different topics or projects.
- 📝 **Notes:** Notes are rich text documents that you can create or generate from your personal media. They are similar to Notion pages, but come with unique features like context-awareness, citations, and tools like web search and app generation (surflets).
- 🌐 **Tabs:** Just like a normal web browser you can open different tabs and navigate between them. Hit `$MOD + T` to open a new tab, `$MOD + W` to close the current tab, and `$MOD + 1-9` to switch between tabs. And hit `$MOD + O` to toggle between vertical and horizontal tab layout.
- ⚡ **Sidebar:** The sidebar gives you quick access to your notebooks, notes, and other resources. You can toggle the sidebar with `$MOD + E`. You can also use it to chat with the currently active tab, your sources, or notebooks.

## 💬 Chatting with a Tab

You can use Surf's AI to chat with the currently active tab. This can be useful for asking questions about the content of the tab, or for getting help with a task. To chat with the active tab, simply open the sidebar (click the "Ask" button in the top left or hit `$MOD + E`), then type your question in the input field at the top of the sidebar and hit enter.

It will create a new note that is saved in your "Drafts" notebook. You can then edit the note, add more context by `@` mentioning sources, or save it to a different notebook by clicking the "bookmarked" button in the top right of the note.

## 📒 Creating a Notebook

To create a new notebook, open the new tab page (click the `+` button in the tab bar or hit `$MOD + T`) and click on the big plus under "<i>Notebooks</i>".

Afterwards you can give your notebook a name and customize its cover by right clicking the cover.

## 🖇️ Adding Media to a Notebook

After you have created a notebook, you can add media like web pages, PDFs, YouTube videos, images, and more into it. To do this, simply navigate to the media you want to add in a tab, then click on the save button in the top right and select the notebook you want to save it into.

## 📝 Create Notes Using Your Notebook

You can also "<i>Ask</i>" your entire notebooks — by navigating to a notebook from the new tab page (`$MOD + T`), and then ask a question in the main input field at the top of the notebook. You could also `@mention` specific sources in your prompt to get more accurate and relevant results.
