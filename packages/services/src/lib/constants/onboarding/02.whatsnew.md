title: ✨ What’s New in the Beta
---

We’ve redesigned and re-engineered Surf completely since the alpha. We still have a lot of work to do, but the core building blocks are coming in place. _If you have used Surf before, here’s what’s new:_

- **Faster and more reliable:** We’ve completely re-engineered Surf's architecture to be faster and more reliable. The app should feel snappier, and the UI more solid.
- **Simpler and more intuitive:** We removed a lot of the complexity that was in the alpha, and focused on the core use cases.
- **Notebooks instead of Contexts:** We doubled down on Notebooks as a more intuitive and powerful way to organize your data. You can have multiple notebooks, and each notebook can have its own set of resources.
